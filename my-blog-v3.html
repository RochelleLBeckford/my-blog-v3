                    <p>
                        I have been a huge fan of various Anime and Manga from
                        my early teens. They literllay touch the soul and bring
                        people from all walks of life together sharing so many
                        differnet emotions but still resonating and appreciating
                        the stories they tell.It can provide insight to a
                        different culture, can be comforting, inspiraitonal, a
                        visual storytelling, help bloom the imagination, and
                        even emotional support. A feel good anime | manga can
                        bring a smile to your face and make you laugh from the
                        depths of your soul.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy cooking a variety of West Indian dishes as that
                        is my culture and especially seafood. I deeply enjoy
                        various Asian cuisines as well. However, I love sushi
                        with every fiber of my being and will eat it any time of
                        the day. In addition, a good Ramen cures the soul after
                        a hard day.
